## Installation
### Step 1: Install MSYS2
- Download the MSYS2 installer from msys2.org.
- Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.
- Open the MSYS2 terminal and update the package database and core system packages:
```bash
pacman -Syu
```
- Close and reopen the terminal, then update everything:
```bash
pacman -Syu
```
### Step 2: Install GTK and Required Tools
Install the necessary packages for GTK development:
- Install the GTK library:
```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk4
```
- Install the MinGW toolchain and other essential tools:
```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-meson
```
- Install pkgconf (used for package configuration):
```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-pkgconf
```
- Install the GLib library (a prerequisite for GTK):
```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-glib2
```

### Step 3: Set Up the Environment
1- Open Environment Variable Settings
- Press Win + S, type Environment Variables, and select Edit the system environment variables.
- In the System Properties window, click the Environment Variables button.
2- Add MinGW Bin Directory to PATH
- Under System Variables, find and select the Path variable, then click Edit.
- Click New and add the path to the MinGW bin directory. For MSYS2, this is typically:
```makefile
C:\msys64\mingw64\bin
```
### Steps 4: to Execute the Program:
1- Locate the .exe File
- Open the cmake-build-debug directory. This is usually in the root folder of your project.
- Look for a file with the .exe extension (e.g., gtk_app.exe).
2- Double-Click to Run
- Double-click the .exe file to execute the program.
- The GTK application window should open, displaying your user interface.
3- Troubleshooting
- If the `.exe` file doesnâ€™t run, ensure all required GTK runtime libraries are in your PATH (see Step 3: Set Up the Environment).
- If you encounter errors related to missing DLLs, confirm that the `mingw64/bin` directory is correctly added to your environment variables.
